# Music Dome by Pawanpreet Mundi

#Completed in around a week impressively, player crashes unexpectedly at times due to Java's MediaPlayer and its poor cooperation with macOS. I have more details on this bug since it took longer to understand than making 99% of the project :) ... :|

#Builtin youtube to mp3 converter to avoid those youtube to mp3 websites that display ads and pop ups. Uses the command line tool for converting youtube to mp3 yt-dlp. brew install yt-dlp on macos first if you want to use this amazing fast tool. The tool downloads the youtube url media to m4a format and converts to mp3 format and stores it in your selected music home directory.

#Open your music directory of downloaded mp3 music with file->change home
#Play the songs from the Music Dome with more control over the music setttings
# Warning: No responsibility for poorly tuning the music. Adjust the frequency, bandwidth sliders at your own risk. The bass can go pretty hard if you find the right settings, and also make your speaker sound broken at other poor settings. Also expect the app to crash after the song finishes if you change these sliders :)

#Really cool, to change the bass, and the rate of the music to any setting, not just 0.75x, 1.25x 1.5x ... 

#perfect app for the old school mp3 lovers and not spotify etc. 
#This app has no intention of promoting piracy, it is for research purposes only
